# Genetic Algorithm Game Players

A Python based Genetic Algorithm program that can learn to play any game. The 2 games added here are Brick, and the Google Chrome Dinosaur Game.


The games make use of a Neural Network to choose what moves to make based on inputs. 
They learn to make better moves by using a Genetic Algorithm.


The module for the Genetic Algorithm being used can be found here: https://github.com/pkotwal/Python-Genetic-Algorithm


Video Demonstrations for the 2 games can be found on the following links
